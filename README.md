# Marketing-Management-Case_2017_Spring
I put several case study reports which were graded 100 by professor Daniel Rajaratnam. Even the white students can not get 100 easily. 
It is not a question of English, but a question of original insight that must be actionable and supported by quantitative analysis. The cases of Intel, Target, and HomeDepot are old, but the insight must be new. Professor used the system TurnItIn which first check how many percentage of similarity between student's report and any of the previous reports which were already turned in in the past decades. The report is not necessarily long but needs to follow professor's format. 

My report was not always 100. The first report of Samsung was only 60, which made me panic. Then I began to get 100 from the second report. A good learning experience.

In this repository, all PDF files are the original case statement, my reports are in WORD. The Excel files are my quantitative analysis 
for the report.
